    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, and analyzing it helps us understand how
        an algorithm behaves as the input size grows. A lower time complexity generally means the algorithm is more
        <u>efficient</u>. The term <i>Time complexity</i> is used to compare different approaches.

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the additional memory an algorithm requires during execution. It tells us how
        memory usage grows with input size. For example, an algorithm with Space Complexity O(n) uses memory that grows
        linearly with the input size.
